# Say

## Project overview

- Target: Obsidian Community Plugin (TypeScript → bundled JavaScript).
- Entry point: `main.ts` compiled to `main.js` and loaded by Obsidian.
- Required release artifacts: `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and optional `styles.css`.

## Environment & tooling

- Node.js: use current LTS (Node 18+ recommended).
- **Package manager: pnpm** (`package.json` defines scripts and dependencies).
- **Bundler: esbuild** (required for this sample - `esbuild.config.mjs` and build scripts depend on it). Alternative bundlers like Rollup or webpack are acceptable for other projects if they bundle all external dependencies into `main.js`.
- Types: `obsidian` type definitions.

**Note**: This sample project has specific technical dependencies on npm and esbuild. If you're creating a plugin from scratch, you can choose different tools, but you'll need to replace the build configuration accordingly.

### Install

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Dev (watch)

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Production build

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Linting

- To use eslint install eslint from terminal: `npm install -g eslint`
- To use eslint to analyze this project use this command: `eslint main.ts`
- eslint will then create a report with suggestions for code improvement by file and line number.
- If your source code is in a folder, such as `src`, you can use eslint with this command to analyze all files in the folder: `eslint ./src/`

## File & folder conventions

- **Organize code into multiple files**: Split functionality across separate modules rather than putting everything in `main.ts`.
- Source lives in `src/`. Keep `main.ts` small and focused on plugin lifecycle (loading, unloading, registering commands).
- **Current file structure**:
  ```
  src/
    main.ts           # Plugin entry point, lifecycle management
    settings.ts       # Settings: enabled, speechRate, triggerDelay
    hover-handler.ts  # HoverHandler: hover-link event, debounce, H1 extraction
    tts.ts            # speak(): cross-platform TTS via child_process (say/spd-say/PowerShell)
    platform.ts       # detectPlatform(): OS detection via Obsidian Platform API
  ```
- **Do not commit build artifacts**: Never commit `node_modules/`, `main.js`, or other generated files to version control.
- Keep the plugin small. Avoid large dependencies. Prefer browser-compatible packages.
- Generated output should be placed at the plugin root or `dist/` depending on your build setup. Release artifacts must end up at the top level of the plugin folder in the vault (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`).

## Manifest rules (`manifest.json`)

- Must include (non-exhaustive):
  - `id` (plugin ID; for local dev it should match the folder name)
  - `name`
  - `version` (Semantic Versioning `x.y.z`)
  - `minAppVersion`
  - `description`
  - `isDesktopOnly` (boolean)
  - Optional: `author`, `authorUrl`, `fundingUrl` (string or map)
- Never change `id` after release. Treat it as stable API.
- Keep `minAppVersion` accurate when using newer APIs.
- Canonical requirements are coded here: https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/.github/workflows/validate-plugin-entry.yml

## Testing

- Manual install for testing: copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css` (if any) to:
  ```
  <Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/<plugin-id>/
  ```
- Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin in **Settings → Community plugins**.

## Commands & settings

- Any user-facing commands should be added via `this.addCommand(...)`.
- If the plugin has configuration, provide a settings tab and sensible defaults.
- Persist settings using `this.loadData()` / `this.saveData()`.
- Use stable command IDs; avoid renaming once released.

## Versioning & releases

- Bump `version` in `manifest.json` (SemVer) and update `versions.json` to map plugin version → minimum app version.
- Create a GitHub release whose tag exactly matches `manifest.json`'s `version`. Do not use a leading `v`.
- Attach `manifest.json`, `main.js`, and `styles.css` (if present) to the release as individual assets.
- After the initial release, follow the process to add/update your plugin in the community catalog as required.

## Security, privacy, and compliance

Follow Obsidian's **Developer Policies** and **Plugin Guidelines**. In particular:

- Default to local/offline operation. Only make network requests when essential to the feature.
- No hidden telemetry. If you collect optional analytics or call third-party services, require explicit opt-in and document clearly in `README.md` and in settings.
- Never execute remote code, fetch and eval scripts, or auto-update plugin code outside of normal releases.
- Minimize scope: read/write only what's necessary inside the vault. Do not access files outside the vault.
- Clearly disclose any external services used, data sent, and risks.
- Respect user privacy. Do not collect vault contents, filenames, or personal information unless absolutely necessary and explicitly consented.
- Avoid deceptive patterns, ads, or spammy notifications.
- Register and clean up all DOM, app, and interval listeners using the provided `register*` helpers so the plugin unloads safely.

## UX & copy guidelines (for UI text, commands, settings)

- Prefer sentence case for headings, buttons, and titles.
- Use clear, action-oriented imperatives in step-by-step copy.
- Use **bold** to indicate literal UI labels. Prefer "select" for interactions.
- Use arrow notation for navigation: **Settings → Community plugins**.
- Keep in-app strings short, consistent, and free of jargon.

## Performance

- Keep startup light. Defer heavy work until needed.
- Avoid long-running tasks during `onload`; use lazy initialization.
- Batch disk access and avoid excessive vault scans.
- Debounce/throttle expensive operations in response to file system events.

## Coding conventions

- TypeScript with `"strict": true` preferred.
- **Keep `main.ts` minimal**: Focus only on plugin lifecycle (onload, onunload, addCommand calls). Delegate all feature logic to separate modules.
- **Split large files**: If any file exceeds ~200-300 lines, consider breaking it into smaller, focused modules.
- **Use clear module boundaries**: Each file should have a single, well-defined responsibility.
- Bundle everything into `main.js` (no unbundled runtime deps).
- Avoid Node/Electron APIs if you want mobile compatibility; set `isDesktopOnly` accordingly.
- Prefer `async/await` over promise chains; handle errors gracefully.

## Mobile

- This plugin is **desktop-only** (`isDesktopOnly: true` in manifest) because it uses `child_process` for system TTS.
- A future version could use the Web Speech API (`speechSynthesis`) for mobile support.

## Agent do/don't

**Do**
- Add commands with stable IDs (don't rename once released).
- Provide defaults and validation in settings.
- Write idempotent code paths so reload/unload doesn't leak listeners or intervals.
- Use `this.register*` helpers for everything that needs cleanup.

**Don't**
- Introduce network calls without an obvious user-facing reason and documentation.
- Ship features that require cloud services without clear disclosure and explicit opt-in.
- Store or transmit vault contents unless essential and consented.

## Architecture

Data flow: `hover-link` event → debounce → resolve linktext to H1 (or filename) → cross-platform TTS command.

### main.ts — Lifecycle
- `onload`: load settings, detect platform, create `HoverHandler`, call `register()`.
- `onunload`: call `hoverHandler.destroy()` to cancel pending speech and unregister event.
- Exposes `settings` and `saveSettings()` for the settings tab.

### hover-handler.ts — HoverHandler
- Listens on the undocumented `hover-link` workspace event.
- Debounces by `triggerDelay` ms (default 300). If the mouse moves to a new link before the timer fires, the previous timer is cancelled.
- Resolves linktext → `metadataCache.getFirstLinkpathDest()` → `getFileCache()` → first H1 heading. Falls back to `file.basename`.
- Kills the previous TTS child process before starting a new one (prevents overlapping voices).

### tts.ts — speak()
- Builds a shell command per platform:
  - **macOS**: `say -r <rate> '<text>'`
  - **Linux**: `spd-say -r <rate> '<text>'`
  - **Windows**: PowerShell `SpeechSynthesizer.Speak()`
- Escapes single/double quotes to prevent shell injection.
- Returns the `ChildProcess` so the caller can `.kill()` it.

### platform.ts — detectPlatform()
- Uses Obsidian's `Platform.isMacOS` / `Platform.isWin` API (not `navigator.userAgent`).
- Returns `"darwin"` | `"linux"` | `"win32"`. Result is cached.

### settings.ts — PluginSettings
- `enabled` (boolean): master toggle for auto-read.
- `speechRate` (number): rate multiplier, 0.5–3.0, default 1.
- `triggerDelay` (number): debounce in ms, 100–1000, default 300.

## Troubleshooting

- Plugin doesn't load after build: ensure `main.js` and `manifest.json` are at the top level of the plugin folder under `<Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/<plugin-id>/`.
- Build issues: if `main.js` is missing, run `npm run build` or `npm run dev` to compile your TypeScript source code.
- Commands not appearing: verify `addCommand` runs after `onload` and IDs are unique.
- Settings not persisting: ensure `loadData`/`saveData` are awaited and you re-render the UI after changes.
- Mobile-only issues: confirm you're not using desktop-only APIs; check `isDesktopOnly` and adjust.
